    "To start, I needed some fee data. Airbnb doesn't just give this out, and their [fee transparency page](https://news.airbnb.com/fee-transparency-on-airbnb/?ref=datafantic.ghost.io) isn't particularly helpful other than to say that hosts set their cleaning fees. So to get the data I needed, I had to resort to scraping the data from the site.\n",

    "My approach was to do a simple search for a city (I picked 12 different cities around the world) and then through the listings using a headless browser to simulate a person browsing. I collected the links for each listing on these pages. Airbnb only gives you 15 pages per search, for a total 300 listings, unless you use other filters. This seemed like a good sample for my purposes."

Importantly, hotels, which Airbnb competes with, don't charge cleaning fees. Even if you save money at an Airbnb compared to a hotel, you still see that cleaning fee on your bill.
