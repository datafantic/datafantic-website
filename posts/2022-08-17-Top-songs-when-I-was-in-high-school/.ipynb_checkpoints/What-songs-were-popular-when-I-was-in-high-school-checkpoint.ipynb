    "Through my exploration of this music, I realized that my core idea remained. Music takes you to a time and a place. Spotify knows what I listen to, my playlists, and what music I hit the heart button for. They know shockingly little else about me.\n",

My current [favorite](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3MzqEKW8DQVFv8cStNSmG2?si=f543759240ac458d&ref=datafantic.ghost.io) seems to be made by someone with very similar tastes to mine.

The same survey found that 70% of shoppers say it takes multiple tries to find what they want.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon's recommendations are terrible. Apple Music has laughable recommendations. Spotify is on the better end of the spectrum, but there is much to be desired. There seems to be an obvious market opportunity here for curation and discoverability for nearly anything."
