Hi, I'm Robert Ritz, the creator of Datafantic. I'm a data scientist and educator. Datafantic is my home for all of my data projects. You can expect to see fun side projects, a critical take on something happening in the world, or resources for other data science professionals. You can guarantee that there will be data and code to back up everything I post (unless it's an opinion).
